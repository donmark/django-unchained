Useful built-in functions, and data structures critical for use with django will be covered. We will be using the python interactive interpreter for a portion of this lesson.\r\n\r\nFlow:\r\n\r\n* Intro to Python: Why Python?\r\n* Data Structures: Strings, Integers, Floats, Dictionaries, Lists, Tuples, Sets.

Django's MVC architecture will be broken down. Django's design philosophies will also be discussed.\r\n\r\n##Session 3: Building a django application Part One\r\nAn interactive session where we will build a fully functioning django application. We will walk through the tutorial presented on https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/.

They can choose from a pre-selected set of tasks or decide on something themselves. Students will present in front of the class and have their code ripped apart.\r\n\r\n##Session 6: Natural Language Processing with Python\r\nFundamental concepts of natural language processing will be discussed.
